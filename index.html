          <div>Who is your tutor / instructor</div>
          <div>Nguyen Minh Long</div>

          <div>Who is your labber</div>
          <div>Nguyen Minh Long</div>

          <div>Have you any programming or web design experience?</div>
          <div>Not exactly. I did setup a website using a template last semester so I at least know my way around HTML.</div>

          <div>Do you see yourself as a programmer or designer, or both?</div>
          <div>Right now I'm leaning forward with being a Front-end developer so I can see myself as both.</div>

          <div>What has brought you to this course at RMIT?</div>
          <div>I want to gain more experience in making my own website from scratch rather than buying or finding a template.</div>

          <div>What are you hoping to get out of the course?</div>
          <div>Atleast the basic understanding of CSS, Javascript and advance my knowledge in HTML.</div>

          <div>Assignments allow for individual or paried work. What strengths do you have and what strengths would you like your assignment partner to have?</div>
          <div>My strength would be when I'm finally in the rhythm, I rarely stop because I'm entirely focus into what I'm doing at the moment. Another strength of mine would be that I'm very flexible in what I'm doing, if I see that something doesn't work I will switch to something that does or when I can do something in a more efficent way I'll switch. As for my partner, I would like that person to be able to push me into my rhythm. Because it ussually takes me a long time to get into the rhythm to do anything.</div>

          <div>What websites do you use the most? (NB: "family friendly" !)</div>
          <div>I switch between Youtube and Reddit. Occasionally I go on Archive of Our Own for stories written by the users.</div>

          <div>Do you have any interests or hobbies?</div>
          <div>I enjoy reading fanfictions and build plastic models.</div>
